# Maze Test

## User Story 1

As a world famous explorer of Mazes I would like a maze to exist so that I can explore it

Acceptance Criteria:

* A Maze (as illustrated in ExampleMaze.txt) consists of walls 'X', Empty spaces ' ', one and only one Start point 'S' and one and only one exit 'F'.

* After a maze has been created the number of walls and empty spaces should be available to me.

* After a maze has been created I should be able to put in a coordinate and know what exists at that point.


## User Story 2

As a world famous explorer of Mazes I would like to exist in a maze and be able to navigate it so that I can explore it

Acceptance Criteria:

* Given a maze the explorer should be able to drop in to the Start point.

* An explorer in a maze must be able to:
    Move forward;
    Turn left and right;
    Understand what is in front of them;
    Understand all movement options from their given location;
    Have a record of where they have been.


## UserStory 3
* An explorer must be able to automatically explore a maze and find the exit, and on exit they must be able to state the route they took in an understandable fashion.


## Assumptions, comments:
- upgraded to java 1.8 to be able to use the latest features java 8 has to offer
- maze dimensions can be different (number of rows and columns should not be equal)
- maze format check is not comprehensive due to time restrictions and to keep things simple, 
  but based on the idea implemented in the solution it should be easily extended with more detailed validation.
- logging framework is not used for now (for production code it would be considered based on debugging / operation needs)
- `main` method is not provided, acceptance tests reading in the input file and verify the criteria based on it
 
## Testing
- `mvn test` to run unit and acceptance tests
